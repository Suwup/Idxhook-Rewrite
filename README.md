Il2CPPInspector DirectX11 Hook written in **C++17**, mainly aimed to be easy to understand and learn from.
Its main goals are to be **universal** (it works on all il2cpp games) and **well documented**.

All functions should be documented.

## Getting Started
Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 is recommended, Idxhook is officially untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Suwup/Idxhook`. Then run `scripts/Win-Premake.bat` and open Idxhook.sln in Visual Studio 2019. `Idxhook/src` contains examples off the code that's running.

If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use `git submodule update --init` to clone the necessary submodules.
