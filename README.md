Idxhook (Il2cpp DirectX 11 Hook) is written in **C++17**, mainly aimed to be easy to understand and learn from.

## Getting Started
Visual Studio 2017, 2019 or 2022 is recommended, Idxhook is officially untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Suwup/Idxhook-Rewrite`. Then run `Win-GenProjects - vs2019.bat` or `Win-GenProjects - vs2022.bat` and open Idxhook.sln in Visual Studio 2019/2022. `Idxhook/src` contains examples off the code that's running.

If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use `git submodule update --init` to clone the necessary submodules.
